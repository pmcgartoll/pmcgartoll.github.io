    <h1>Project Abacus</h1>
    <p>Project Abacus is a <i>ranged boxing</i> VR game idea that I've had sitting in the back of my mind for a little
        while.</p>
    <h4>Why do I want to make a game?</h4>
    <p>I've always struggled to convince myself that playing games is a worthwhile
        use of time, and so convincing myself
        that developing a game is a productive use of time is even tougher! I recall reading somewhere (probably on
        reddit) about how Pokemon can be thought of as a DDOS attack against the world's children. I've never been able
        to look at gaming the same way since.</p>
    <p>But alas, the draw of game development is too strong. It's the whole reason I got into programming in the first
        place. So how can I make a game that actually feels productive to play? That's where VR and fitness come in.</p>
    <h4>VR + Fitness</h4>
    <p>I purchased an Oculus Quest 2 over the pandemic, it was my very first VR experience, and it totally blew my mind.
        One positive side effect was that it got me super active. There are plenty of great games which give you a good
        workout (Beat Saber) but I actually used a boxing game called Thrill of the Fight (TOFT) as my daily workout for
        about a month. I would be drenched in sweat just five minutes into a session of TOFT.</p>
    <p>I was a bit more disappointed with the actual fitness focused games in VR though, I won't list any
        specific ones but all of them felt far too focused on the fitness than the actual game and engagement. It's kind
        of like the difference between going to the gym to workout or playing soccer. Both are fantastic workouts but
        with soccer the workout you get is secondary to just playing the game itself. I think there could be tremendous
        value in a VR game which feels like playing soccer or some other sport. The game is the primary focus but a
        secondary result of playing would be a fantastic workout.</p>
    <h4>Why <i>Ranged Boxing</i>?</h4>
    <p>I know "ranged boxing" sounds really dumb but I don't have a better way to describe it right now and at least it
        gets the point across. So, TOFT was awesome and a great workout but it got a bit stale just fighting 1-1 with a
        computer. VR allows us to create a reality not possible in the real world and when I looked around at all the VR
        Boxing games available they were all just replicating "real" boxing. I think there's great potential in a game
        that allows you to fight tons of enemies using boxing moves.</p>
    <p>Imagine jabs that shot out a projectile, crosses that create a sweeping wave taking out multiple foes, uppercuts
        and launch bombs into the air, and special boxing combos that unleash devastating damage on an enemy army. We
        can't do these things in real-life but in VR it would be possible. This ability to become super-human would (I
        think) be far more engaging than just replicating "real" boxing. Not only would it be a fun game, but it would
        also be a fantastic workout, your ability to take out more enemies is limited only by your actual physical
        fitness.</p>
    <p>This is a high-level view of the vision I have in mind right now, I'm sure it will change over time but I can't
        help but get excited about this idea. So I want to build it!</p>
