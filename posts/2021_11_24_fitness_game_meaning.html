    <h1>Thinking about fitness games</h1>
    <p>I've been thinking a lot recently about what it means to make a fitness game. The main idea I've been thinking
        about recently is one I actually put in my intro post, and I wanted to use this post to expand on that. This is
        the line I'm talking about: "your ability to take out more enemies is limited only by your actual physical
        fitness."</p>
    <h4>Progress in games</h4>
    <p>Progress in games can take on a lot of different forms, for many "casual" games progress is purely in the form of
        numbers. Your level increases or your stats grow. You as a player are not necessarily getting better at the
        game, but the game is rewarding you for sinking time into it. For more "hardcore" games there is a very high
        skill-ceiling and progress in the game is only possible when you actually train specific skills. All games have
        some combination of both kinds of progression.</p>
    <h4>Fitness in terms of games progression</h4>
    <p>If we try and apply the above framework onto fitness I think people fall into two camps, casual folks and
        hardcore fitness enthusiasts. I used to place myself into the hardcore camp, progress only came in the form of
        putting up more weight, I would measure myself by my bench press/squat weight. Now I've become much more casual,
        I've gotten into running and my progress doesn't have much to do with how fast I am but just how many days I
        actually run, and the number of miles I put up. I don't necessarily care about seeing my mile time decrease on
        every single run, I feel rewarded just knowing that as I sink more time into it I can see my number of miles run
        go up. But, crucially, when I am feeling good I run faster and further, I can get that hardcore experience even
        with casual running and it feels great. I still do like to push my body when I'm feeling it, I just don't feel
        like I have to every single day now.</p>
    <h4>The current fitness game landscape</h4>
    <p>I'm going to preface this section by saying that I have not done much research in this space. I've tried out a
        decent number of fitness games, and I think I have a general idea of the current landscape, but I could be
        totally off-base with my analysis here and would love some feedback. My personal belief is that fitness games
        fall on the side of the "casual" progression I've been referring to. They are far more about investing time than
        in "putting up more weight." And I think this has to do with the fact that it's difficult for a game to
        challenge a player like a rack of weights can. Let's take a look at a few games to drive the point home, because
        I'm sure many people are disagreeing with me right now.</p>
    <p><a href="https://ringfitadventure.nintendo.com/">Ring Fit Adventure</a>: I bought this game because I was super
        excited about gamified fitness, there were some
        articles going around about people losing tons of weight and getting in great shape thanks to this game and it
        totally suckered me into buying one. But I'm already decently fit and the game got old very fast. In
        talking with friends who also own the game, they experienced the same issue. The game "progresses" by just
        ratcheting up the number of squats/arm swings/etc you do. Difficulty is just measured by the amount of time you
        put in. The intensity never really gets higher. Fights that were at first fun begin to get boring
        because they just stretch on for way too long. This is essentially pretty eye-candy to a squat counter.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.getsupernatural.com/">Supernatural</a> (Disclaimer, I work for
        Meta which now owns Supernatural): I only gave this a few
        tries during a free trial but I felt like I got the gist of it pretty
        quickly. This is definitely a fitness first app, not a game, and it has a few different difficulty
        levels which you do themed workouts to. The whole experience is really polished and well done but got old for me
        very
        quickly. Once you've progressed up to the hard difficulty you are basically just stuck doing workouts at this
        level for longer and longer amounts of time. Getting up to the hard difficulty is not very much work for someone
        who is decently fit and once you're there it doesn't feel like you'll be able to get much more out of the
        experience. You feel limited by the difficulty settings in the game, if you feel a burst of adrenaline you can't
        take that out in the game, you have to hit the orbs at the exact cadence the game wants you to.</p>
    <p><a href="https://sealostinteractive.com/">Thrill of the Fight</a>: This game is very different than the above
        two, your ability to take out an enemy is truly
        based on your own fitness. This is the very first experience where I felt totally winded after five minutes
        playing a game, and I realized it was because the game felt "unlocked." I was not being limited by the game, the
        more intensity I put in the more I got out. The harder and faster I punched the quicker I was able to take out
        my opponent. There was no cadence I had to follow, no specific exercise I was limited to doing, I was limited
        only by my own body and my own fitness and it felt really freeing. Because of that I pushed myself far harder in
        this game than I ever had in any fitness-focused app.</p>
    <h4>Takeaways</h4>
    <p>It's really valuable to "unlock" the player. Don't limit them by specific game
        mechanics or forcing things to go at a certain cadence. This is much more realistic to how sports and fitness
        work in the real world. Too many fitness apps focus on the "casual" style of progress, and they not only focus
        on this but they design the game such that it limits the player to only experience "casual" fitness. I think
        there would be great value in a game that allows for a "hardcore" fitness style of play. I believe it will make
        for a better game, a better workout, and a much more fulfilling experience.</p>
