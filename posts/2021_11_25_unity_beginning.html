    <h1>Starting development</h1>
    <p>The title here is a bit of a misnomer, I actually began development during 2020, locked inside due to COVID. I
        still have a build titled "Gun Boxing" on my Quest 2 from that attempt but I didn't get very far. That's when I
        originally had the idea though, and I had already fleshed out most of my thoughts on what I wanted a "ranged
        boxing" game to look like. Then I dropped it until about a month ago.</p>

    <p>I found myself going down the Youtube rabbit hole on GDC videos and it got me inspired to start working on the
        game again. If you haven't watched them before I'd highly recommend going and checking out the GDC talks posted
        on Youtube, the quality bar is incredibly high and they pretty much always teach me something/leave me inspired.
        So, after watching quite a few I decided to get back into it and open up Unity again.
    </p>
    <h4>Why Unity?</h4>
    <p>I wanted to make sure I write this down because I'm curious if I'll regret this in the future. Why Unity? I have
        no clue, because people online say it's a good place to start. That's it, I did not do much research and I
        really didn't give it much thought.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code?uv=2020.3">Unity Learn: Create with Code</a></h4>
    <p>Unity did turn out to be a fantastic choice for at least one reason, this course. I was amazed at the level of
        quality shown in this course, any company attempting to teach newcomers how to use their product needs to
        seriously watch and take notes from this class. It is very approachable, very little code knowledge is required,
        and by the end of it you will absolutely feel comfortable inside of Unity. It is definitely a time-commitment,
        but the class is structured so that you only ever watch short videos (typically 5 mins or less). How do they do
        this?</p>
    <p>Through a technique they call "Watch, then do." And it is fantastic for keeping an audience engaged. It's a super
        simple concept, watch the short video, devote your attention to it completely, and then when the video is
        finished go and do what you were instructed to in the video. If you've ever tried learning coding concepts it's
        typically in a "follow-along" style where you are watching a video, trying to parse the content, and also trying
        to write the code at the same time. This is terrible for retention, I never remember whatever I was supposed to
        learn from those videos. The other strategy is a long video lecture where you need to process the material
        (similar to college) but this is not a very engaging technique and will quickly lose my attention, especially
        outside of the college environment where I'm paying to learn. If I'm just at home working casually on a personal
        project it's very easy to get distracted and I find that happening a lot with hour-long lecture style videos.
        The technique for the "Create with Code" class was remarkably good because it made it easy to watch just "one
        more video" since they're all so short. At the same time it forced me to actually process what I was learning
        because I'd have to remember what the video was about and go apply it to the code once the video was finished.
    </p>
    <h4>What now?</h4>
    <p>I've finished the "Create with Code" class now (first time I think I've ever finished an online course that
        wasn't part of college), and I'm starting to test out development ideas for this game. My first goal is to
        create a "debugging" environment of sorts. A place where I can try out different ideas, get the punching to feel
        good, and start to iron out how the gameplay might work. Right now I've got a super simple setup that I can test
        in VR which just shows some stats on your hand velocities. It is a pretty wild feeling developing in 3D and then
        putting on a VR headset and actually having your development become your reality. This is much different than
        the backend services development I'm doing at my day job. Talk about immersion!</p>
